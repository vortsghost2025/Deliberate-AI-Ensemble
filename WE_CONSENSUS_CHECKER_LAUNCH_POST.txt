The entire AI industry is selling 16 different fire extinguishers.

I figured out how to build houses that don't catch fire.

Proof: Got tired of biased fact-checkers. Built this in 4 hours last night.

WE Consensus Checker
→ 3 independent AI agents (zero shared context)
→ All outputs raw & unedited (total transparency)
→ Disagreement IS the signal (honesty over comfort)
→ No logs. No agenda. 100% free.

When agents disagree, you know the claim is contested.
That's the truth every other fact-checker hides from you.

Try it with your most controversial hot take. I'll wait.
