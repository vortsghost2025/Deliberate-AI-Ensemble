# 21. Observability Architecture

## 21.1 Observability Philosophy

The observability philosophy ensures that the system can understand its own internal state through measurable signals. Observability enables insight, diagnosis, and verification without requiring direct access to internal mechanisms.

## 21.2 Observability Signals

Observability signals include logs, metrics, traces, state indicators, and behavioral markers. Each signal provides a different perspective on system activity, enabling comprehensive visibility.

## 21.3 Observability Processes

Observability processes define how signals are collected, interpreted, and used to understand system behavior. These processes ensure that insights are accurate, timely, and aligned with system rules.

## 21.4 Observability Guarantees

The system guarantees that observability remains consistent, reliable, and free from interference. These guarantees ensure that the system can always be monitored, understood, and validated.
