# 19. Recovery Architecture

## 19.1 Rec

The recovery philosophy ensures that the system can return to a stable state after disruptions, failures, or unexpected conditions. Recovery is treated as a structured, rule-bound process that prioritizes clarity and safety.

## 19.2 Recovery Types

Recovery types include soft recovery, hard recovery, state restoration, and controlled reset. Each type addresses a different level of disruption and follows strict rules to prevent data loss or instability.

## 19.3 Recovery Processes

Recovery processes define how the system identifies failures, initiates recovery actions, and restores normal operation. These processes are predictable, repeatable, and designed to prevent cascading issues.

## 19.4 Recovery Guarantees

The system guarantees that recovery will occur safely, consistently, and without introducing new risks. These guarantees ensure long-term stability and resilience.
