# 29. Interface Architecture

## 29.1 Interface Philosophy

The interface philosophy ensures that all points of interaction between components, agents, and external systems are structured, predictable, and safe. Interfaces exist to reduce ambiguity and enforce clarity.

## 29.2 Interface Types

Interface types include data interfaces, execution interfaces, communication interfaces, and control interfaces. Each type defines how information or actions flow between components.

## 29.3 Interface Rules

Interface rules specify allowed formats, protocols, boundaries, and behaviors. These rules ensure that interactions remain consistent, safe, and aligned with system constraints.

## 29.4 Interface Guarantees

The system guarantees that interfaces remain stable, documented, and protected from unauthorized modification. These guarantees ensure predictable and safe interactions.
