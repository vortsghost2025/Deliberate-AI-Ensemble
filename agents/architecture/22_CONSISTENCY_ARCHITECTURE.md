# 22. Consistency Architecture

## 22.1 Consistency Philosophy

The consistency philosophy ensures that the system behaves the same way under the same conditions. Consistency prevents ambiguity, drift, and unpredictable behavior across all components.

## 22.2 Consistency Types

Consistency types include behavioral consistency, data consistency, rule consistency, and execution consistency. Each type reinforces predictable and stable system operation.

## 22.3 Consistency Controls

Consistency controls enforce uniform behavior across agents, processes, and data flows. Controls include rule enforcement, validation layers, and standardized execution pathways.

## 22.4 Consistency Guarantees

The system guarantees that consistency is maintained across all operations, ensuring predictable outcomes and stable long-term behavior.
