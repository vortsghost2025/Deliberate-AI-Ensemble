# 25. Versioning Architecture

## 25.1 Versioning Philosophy

The versioning philosophy ensures that all system changes are tracked, documented, and recoverable. Versioning provides clarity, accountability, and long-term stability.

## 25.2 Versioning Rules

Versioning rules define how versions are created, labeled, and managed. These rules ensure that every change is identifiable, traceable, and reversible.

## 25.3 Versioning Processes

Versioning processes specify how updates are recorded, how previous states are preserved, and how version transitions occur. These processes maintain continuity and prevent loss of information.

## 25.4 Versioning Guarantees

The system guarantees that all versions remain accessible, documented, and recoverable. These guarantees ensure long-term clarity and protect against corruption or loss.
