# 32. Scaling Architecture

## 32.1 Scaling Philosophy

The scaling philosophy ensures that the system can grow in capacity, complexity, or capability without compromising stability or safety. Scaling must occur predictably and within defined boundaries.

## 32.2 Scaling Types

Scaling types include vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, behavioral scaling, and modular scaling. Each type expands system capability while preserving architectural integrity.

## 32.3 Scaling Controls

Scaling controls define how growth is validated, authorized, and integrated. Controls ensure that scaling does not exceed system limits or introduce instability.

## 32.4 Scaling Guarantees

The system guarantees that scaling occurs safely, predictably, and without violating architectural constraints. These guarantees protect long-term performance and reliability.
