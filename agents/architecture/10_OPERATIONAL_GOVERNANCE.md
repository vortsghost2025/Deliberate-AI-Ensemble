# 10. Governance Architecture

## 10.1 Governance Philosophy

The governance philosophy emphasizes oversight, clarity, and accountability. Governance ensures that all system behavior aligns with defined rules, safety requirements, and long‑term objectives. It provides structure and prevents drift, ambiguity, or unauthorized changes.

## 10.2 Governance Roles

Governance roles define who or what is responsible for oversight, decision approval, rule enforcement, and system integrity. These roles ensure that no component operates without accountability and that all actions remain traceable and justified.

## 10.3 Governance Processes

Governance processes include review cycles, approval workflows, audits, and rule updates. These processes maintain system stability by ensuring that changes are deliberate, justified, and aligned with the system’s philosophy and constraints.

## 10.4 Governance Boundaries

Governance boundaries define the limits of authority and control. They ensure that governance mechanisms do not overreach, conflict with safety layers, or interfere with execution pathways. Boundaries maintain clarity and prevent overlapping responsibilities.
