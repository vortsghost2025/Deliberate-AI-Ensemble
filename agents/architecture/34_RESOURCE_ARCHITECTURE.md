# 34. Resource Architecture

## 34.1 Resource Philosophy

The resource philosophy ensures that all system resources are allocated, consumed, and released in a controlled and predictable manner. Resources must never be exhausted, leaked, or misused.

## 34.2 Resource Types

Resource types include computational resources, memory resources, data resources, and execution resources. Each type is governed independently to prevent overload or starvation.

## 34.3 Resource Controls

Resource controls enforce limits, quotas, and allocation rules that ensure fair and safe usage. Controls prevent resource contention, exhaustion, and unauthorized consumption.

## 34.4 Resource Guarantees

The system guarantees that resources remain available, controlled, and protected from misuse. These guarantees ensure stable and predictable operation.
