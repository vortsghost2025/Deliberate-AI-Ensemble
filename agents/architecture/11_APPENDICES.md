# 11. Alignment Architecture

## 11.1 Alignment Philosophy

The alignment philosophy ensures that all system behavior remains consistent with its purpose, constraints, and long‑term goals. Alignment is treated as a continuous requirement, not a one‑time configuration. The system assumes that misalignment emerges from ambiguity, drift, or unbounded behavior.

## 11.2 Alignment Mechanisms

Alignment mechanisms include rule enforcement, constraint layers, validation checks, and governance oversight. These mechanisms work together to ensure that agents and processes remain within the system’s intended direction and do not deviate from defined expectations.

## 11.3 Alignment Checks

Alignment checks verify that actions, decisions, and outputs remain consistent with system rules and objectives. These checks occur at multiple stages and serve as safeguards against drift, misinterpretation, or unintended behavior.

## 11.4 Alignment Guarantees

The system guarantees that alignment is maintained through strict rules, layered safeguards, and continuous monitoring. These guarantees ensure that the system remains stable, predictable, and true to its intended purpose over time.
