# 8. Communication Architecture

## 8.1 Communication Philosophy

The communication philosophy emphasizes clarity, structure, and predictability. Communication is never informal, ambiguous, or improvisational. All interactions follow defined rules that ensure information is exchanged in a controlled and consistent manner.

## 8.2 Communication Channels

Communication occurs through structured channels that define how agents exchange information. Each channel has a specific purpose, format, and set of rules. The system avoids unbounded or ad‑hoc communication, ensuring that all interactions remain traceable and aligned with system constraints.

## 8.3 Communication Rules

Communication rules govern how information is formatted, transmitted, and interpreted. These rules prevent ambiguity, enforce consistency, and ensure that all messages remain within the system’s operational boundaries. Agents must follow these rules exactly to maintain clarity and alignment.

## 8.4 Communication Boundaries

Communication boundaries define what agents can and cannot communicate. These boundaries prevent unauthorized information sharing, limit cross‑component interference, and ensure that communication remains aligned with safety and operational constraints. Boundaries reinforce predictable and disciplined behavior.
