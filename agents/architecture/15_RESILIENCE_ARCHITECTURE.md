# 15. Resilience Architecture

## 15.1 Resilience Philosophy

The resilience philosophy ensures that the system can withstand disruptions, recover from failures, and maintain stable operation under stress. Resilience is treated as a core requirement, enabling the system to continue functioning even when unexpected conditions occur.

## 15.2 Resilience Mechanisms

Resilience mechanisms include redundancy, fallback pathways, controlled degradation, and automated recovery procedures. These mechanisms ensure that the system can adapt to disruptions without compromising safety or alignment.

## 15.3 Resilience Recovery

Resilience recovery defines how the system restores normal operation after a failure or disruption. Recovery processes are structured, predictable, and designed to prevent cascading issues. The system prioritizes stability and clarity during recovery.

## 15.4 Resilience Guarantees

The system guarantees resilience through layered protections, controlled recovery processes, and continuous monitoring. These guarantees ensure that the system remains stable and reliable even when encountering unexpected conditions.
