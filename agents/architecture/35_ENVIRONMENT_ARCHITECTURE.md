# 35. Environment Architecture

## 35.1 Environment Philosophy

The environment philosophy ensures that the system operates within clearly defined and controlled environments. Each environment provides boundaries, safeguards, and predictable conditions for execution.

## 35.2 Environment Types

Environment types include development environment, testing environment, staging environment, and production environment. Each type serves a distinct purpose and follows strict separation rules.

## 35.3 Environment Controls

Environment controls enforce isolation, access restrictions, and configuration rules that prevent cross-environment interference or contamination.

## 35.4 Environment Guarantees

The system guarantees that environments remain isolated, consistent, and protected from unauthorized changes. These guarantees ensure safe testing, deployment, and execution.
