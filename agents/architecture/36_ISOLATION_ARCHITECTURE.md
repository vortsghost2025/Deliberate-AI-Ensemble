# 36. Isolation Architecture

## 36.1 Isolation Philosophy
Isolation ensures that components, agents, and processes operate without unintended interference. Isolation protects boundaries and prevents cross‑contamination.

## 36.2 Isolation Types
Isolation types include process isolation, data isolation, execution isolation, and environment isolation.

## 36.3 Isolation Controls
Controls enforce strict separation through permissions, sandboxing, and scoped execution pathways.

## 36.4 Isolation Guarantees
The system guarantees that isolated components remain independent, protected, and unaffected by external behavior.
