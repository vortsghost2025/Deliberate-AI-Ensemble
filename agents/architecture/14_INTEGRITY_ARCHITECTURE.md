# 14. Integrity Architecture

## 14.1 Integrity Philosophy

The integrity philosophy ensures that the system remains trustworthy, consistent, and resistant to corruption. Integrity is treated as a foundational requirement that protects the system’s purpose, rules, and long-term stability.

## 14.2 Integrity Checks

Integrity checks verify that data, processes, and agent behavior remain unaltered, consistent, and aligned with system rules. These checks occur regularly and automatically to detect drift, tampering, or unintended changes.

## 14.3 Integrity Safeguards

Integrity safeguards include redundancy, validation layers, controlled write-access, and rule-based protections that prevent unauthorized modifications. These safeguards ensure that the system cannot be altered in ways that compromise safety or alignment.

## 14.4 Integrity Guarantees

The system guarantees integrity through continuous monitoring, strict enforcement, and layered protections. These guarantees ensure that the system remains stable, predictable, and aligned with its intended design over time.
