# 30. Extension Architecture

## 30.1 Extension Philosophy

The extension philosophy ensures that the system can grow, evolve, and incorporate new capabilities without compromising stability or safety. Extensions must integrate cleanly and predictably.

## 30.2 Extension Types

Extension types include modular extensions, behavioral extensions, data extensions, and interface extensions. Each type expands system capability while respecting existing boundaries.

## 30.3 Extension Controls

Extension controls enforce rules that govern how new capabilities are added, validated, and integrated. Controls ensure that extensions cannot override core safeguards or introduce instability.

## 30.4 Extension Guarantees

The system guarantees that extensions remain safe, aligned, and fully compatible with existing architecture. These guarantees protect long-term stability and prevent fragmentation.
