# 43. Failsafe Architecture

## 43.1 Failsafe Philosophy
Failsafes ensure the system defaults to safety when uncertainty or failure occurs.

## 43.2 Failsafe Types
Types include execution failsafes, communication failsafes, and state failsafes.

## 43.3 Failsafe Controls
Controls halt unsafe actions and revert to known-safe states.

## 43.4 Failsafe Guarantees
The system guarantees that safety takes priority over execution.
