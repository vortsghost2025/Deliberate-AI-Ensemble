# 12. Monitoring Architecture

## 12.1 Monitoring Philosophy

The monitoring philosophy emphasizes continuous awareness, early detection, and proactive intervention. Monitoring exists to identify deviations before they become failures, ensuring that the system remains stable, aligned, and predictable at all times.

## 12.2 Monitoring Channels

Monitoring channels define how the system observes agent behavior, data flow, execution pathways, and safety boundaries. Each channel has a specific purpose and operates independently to ensure comprehensive coverage without overlap or blind spots.

## 12.3 Monitoring Rules

Monitoring rules specify what conditions must be tracked, what thresholds trigger alerts, and how anomalies are classified. These rules ensure that monitoring remains consistent, objective, and aligned with the system’s safety and governance requirements.

## 12.4 Monitoring Escalation

When monitoring detects a deviation or anomaly, escalation pathways determine how the issue is handled. Escalation may involve halting execution, invoking safety layers, or transferring control to governance mechanisms. This ensures that no anomaly is ignored or left unresolved.
