# 38. Latency Architecture

## 38.1 Latency Philosophy
Latency is managed to ensure predictable timing and responsiveness.

## 38.2 Latency Types
Types include execution latency, communication latency, and data retrieval latency.

## 38.3 Latency Controls
Controls include timeouts, rate limits, and performance thresholds.

## 38.4 Latency Guarantees
The system guarantees stable timing behavior under defined conditions.
