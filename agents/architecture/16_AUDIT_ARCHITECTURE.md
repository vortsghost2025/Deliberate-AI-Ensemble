# 16. Audit Architecture

## 16.1 Audit Philosophy

The audit philosophy ensures that all system behavior remains transparent, traceable, and accountable. Audits exist to verify that rules are followed, safeguards are functioning, and no unauthorized changes or deviations have occurred.

## 16.2 Audit Types

The system uses multiple audit types, including behavioral audits, data audits, execution audits, and governance audits. Each type examines a different dimension of system operation to ensure comprehensive oversight.

## 16.3 Audit Processes

Audit processes define how information is collected, reviewed, and validated. These processes are structured, repeatable, and designed to detect inconsistencies, violations, or misalignments. All audits follow predefined procedures to ensure objectivity and reliability.

## 16.4 Audit Guarantees

The system guarantees that audits occur regularly, consistently, and without interference. These guarantees ensure long-term accountability, maintain system integrity, and reinforce trust in the system’s behavior and governance.
