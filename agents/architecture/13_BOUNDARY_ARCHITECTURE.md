# 13. Boundary Architecture

## 13.1 Boundary Philosophy

The boundary philosophy asserts that clear limits are essential for safe and predictable system behavior. Boundaries define what agents can access, modify, or influence, ensuring that all operations remain within controlled and authorized zones.

## 13.2 Boundary Types

The system uses multiple types of boundaries, including data boundaries, execution boundaries, communication boundaries, and role boundaries. Each type restricts a different dimension of behavior, creating a layered and comprehensive safety perimeter.

## 13.3 Boundary Enforcement

Boundary enforcement ensures that agents cannot cross limits or perform actions outside their authorized scope. Enforcement mechanisms include permission checks, validation gates, and automated blockers that prevent unauthorized behavior.

## 13.4 Boundary Violations

When a boundary violation occurs, the system responds immediately by halting the action, logging the event, and escalating to higher-level safeguards. Violations are treated as critical signals that require investigation and corrective action.
