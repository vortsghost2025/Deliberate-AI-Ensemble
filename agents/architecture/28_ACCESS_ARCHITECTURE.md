# 28. Access Architecture

## 28.1 Access Philosophy

The access philosophy ensures that all system interactions occur through controlled, authorized, and clearly defined pathways. Access is never implicit or assumed.

## 28.2 Access Types

Access types include read access, write access, execution access, and administrative access. Each type is governed independently to prevent overreach or unintended influence.

## 28.3 Access Controls

Access controls enforce permissions, boundaries, and restrictions that determine who or what can interact with system components. Controls ensure that access remains safe, minimal, and aligned with system rules.

## 28.4 Access Guarantees

The system guarantees that access remains restricted, auditable, and aligned with defined permissions. These guarantees prevent unauthorized behavior and protect system integrity.
