# 20. Validation Architecture

## 20.1 Validation Philosophy

The validation philosophy ensures that all inputs, outputs, and internal operations meet defined standards before being accepted or executed. Validation prevents ambiguity, errors, and unsafe behavior.

## 20.2 Validation Types

Validation types include data validation, rule validation, execution validation, and boundary validation. Each type ensures that the system remains aligned with its constraints and expectations.

## 20.3 Validation Processes

Validation processes define how checks are performed, what conditions must be met, and how failures are handled. These processes ensure that no action proceeds without meeting required criteria.

## 20.4 Validation Guarantees

The system guarantees that validation occurs consistently and without exception. These guarantees ensure that all operations remain safe, predictable, and aligned with system rules.
