# 37. Separation of Concerns Architecture

## 37.1 SoC Philosophy
Separation of concerns ensures that each component has a single, clear responsibility.

## 37.2 SoC Types
Types include functional separation, data separation, execution separation, and governance separation.

## 37.3 SoC Controls
Controls prevent components from taking on responsibilities outside their domain.

## 37.4 SoC Guarantees
The system guarantees clarity, modularity, and maintainability through strict separation.
