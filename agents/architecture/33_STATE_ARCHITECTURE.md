# 33. State Architecture

## 33.1 State Philosophy

The state philosophy ensures that all system states are controlled, observable, and recoverable. State is treated as a critical resource that must remain consistent and protected.

## 33.2 State Types

State types include active state, passive state, persistent state, and transitional state. Each type defines how the system stores, manages, and transitions between conditions.

## 33.3 State Controls

State controls enforce rules for how state is created, modified, stored, and restored. Controls prevent corruption, unauthorized changes, and inconsistent transitions.

## 33.4 State 

The system guarantees that state remains consistent, recoverable, and aligned with system rules. These guarantees protect stability and prevent drift.
