# 18. Update Architecture

## 18.1 Update Philosophy

The update philosophy ensures that all changes to the system are deliberate, controlled, and aligned with long-term stability. Updates must never introduce ambiguity, risk, or unvalidated behavior.

## 18.2 Update Types

Update types include rule updates, configuration updates, dependency updates, and structural updates. Each type follows its own safeguards to ensure that changes do not disrupt system integrity.

## 18.3 Update Processes

Update processes define how changes are proposed, reviewed, validated, and applied. These processes ensure that updates occur predictably and with full accountability, preventing unauthorized or unsafe modifications.

## 18.4 Update Guarantees

The system guarantees that updates will be applied safely, consistently, and with full traceability. These guarantees protect system stability and prevent regressions or unintended behavior.
