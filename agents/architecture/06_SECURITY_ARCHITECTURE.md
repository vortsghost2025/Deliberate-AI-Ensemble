# 6. Execution Architecture

## 6.1 Execution Philosophy

The execution philosophy emphasizes controlled, predictable, and rule‑bound action. Execution is never improvisational or autonomous; it follows predefined pathways that ensure safety and alignment. The system treats execution as a tightly governed process where every step is validated, constrained, and monitored.

## 6.2 Execution Pipeline

The execution pipeline consists of sequential stages that transform inputs into outputs through structured processing. Each stage has a clear purpose, defined boundaries, and strict validation requirements. Agents move through the pipeline in a controlled manner, ensuring that no action bypasses required checks or safeguards.

## 6.3 Execution Constraints

Execution is constrained by rules, permissions, rate limits, and boundary conditions that prevent unsafe or unintended behavior. These constraints ensure that agents operate only within their authorized scope and cannot perform actions that exceed system capabilities or violate safety requirements.

## 6.4 Execution Guarantees

The system guarantees that execution will be consistent, repeatable, and aligned with defined rules. It ensures that actions follow the same pathways every time, that safeguards are always applied, and that no execution step occurs without validation. These guarantees create a stable and trustworthy operational environment.
