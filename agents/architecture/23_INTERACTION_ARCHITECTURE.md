# 23. Interaction Architecture

## 23.1 Interaction Philosophy

The interaction philosophy ensures that all exchanges between agents, components, and processes occur in a controlled, structured, and predictable manner. Interaction is never ad‑hoc or improvisational.

## 23.2 Interaction Types

Interaction types include agent-to-agent interactions, agent-to-system interactions, system-to-environment interactions, and internal component interactions. Each type follows strict rules to prevent ambiguity or interference.

## 23.3 Interaction Rules

Interaction rules define how information is exchanged, what formats are allowed, and what boundaries must be respected. These rules ensure clarity, safety, and alignment across all interactions.

## 23.4 Interaction Guarantees

The system guarantees that interactions remain structured, safe, and aligned with system constraints. These guarantees prevent miscommunication and unintended behavior.
