# 27. Security Architecture

## 27.1 Security Philosophy

The security philosophy ensures that the system remains protected against unauthorized access, manipulation, or interference. Security is treated as a foundational requirement that supports all other architectural layers.

## 27.2 Security Layers

Security layers include authentication, authorization, data protection, execution protection, and environmental safeguards. Each layer reinforces the others to create a comprehensive defense.

## 27.3 Security Controls

Security controls enforce rules that prevent unauthorized actions, detect threats, and protect sensitive components. Controls include access restrictions, validation gates, encryption, and behavioral monitoring.

## 27.4 Security Guarantees

The system guarantees that security protections remain active, consistent, and resistant to tampering. These guarantees ensure long-term safety and trustworthiness.
