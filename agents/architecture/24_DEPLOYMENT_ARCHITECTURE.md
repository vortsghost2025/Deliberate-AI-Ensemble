# 24. Deployment Architecture

## 24.1 Deployment Philosophy

The deployment philosophy ensures that system components are released in a controlled, predictable, and safe manner. Deployment must never introduce instability, ambiguity, or unvalidated behavior.

## 24.2 Deployment Types

Deployment types include initial deployment, incremental deployment, staged deployment, and rollback deployment. Each type follows strict safeguards to maintain system stability.

## 24.3 Deployment Processes

Deployment processes define how components are prepared, validated, released, and monitored. These processes ensure that deployments occur safely and with full accountability.

## 24.4 Deployment Guarantees

The system guarantees that deployments are safe, traceable, and reversible. These guarantees protect system integrity and prevent unintended consequences.
