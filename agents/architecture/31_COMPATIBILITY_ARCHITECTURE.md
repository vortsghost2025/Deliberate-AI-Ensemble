# 31. Compatibility Architecture

## 31.1 Compatibility Philosophy

The compatibility philosophy ensures that all components, extensions, and updates remain interoperable with the system’s existing rules, structures, and safeguards. Compatibility prevents fragmentation and preserves long-term stability.

## 31.2 Compatibility Types

Compatibility types include structural compatibility, behavioral compatibility, data compatibility, and interface compatibility. Each type ensures that new or modified components integrate cleanly with the system.

## 31.3 Compatibility Controls

Compatibility controls enforce rules that validate whether components can safely interact. Controls include version checks, schema validation, interface verification, and behavioral alignment checks.

## 31.4 Compatibility Guarantees

The system guarantees that all components remain compatible with core architecture and constraints. These guarantees prevent conflicts, instability, and unpredictable behavior.
