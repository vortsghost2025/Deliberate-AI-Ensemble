# 9. Agent Architecture

## 9.1 Agent Roles

Agents operate as specialized components within the system, each with a clearly defined role and scope. Their responsibilities are narrow, explicit, and aligned with the system’s overall purpose. Agents do not improvise or self‑assign tasks; they perform only the functions they were designed for.

## 9.2 Agent Constraints

Agents are bound by strict constraints that limit their autonomy and prevent unsafe behavior. These constraints include rule sets, permission boundaries, execution limits, and communication restrictions. Constraints ensure that agents remain predictable and aligned with system expectations.

## 9.3 Agent Interfaces

Agents interact with the system through structured interfaces that define how they receive inputs, produce outputs, and communicate with other components. These interfaces are explicit, stable, and designed to prevent ambiguity or unauthorized behavior.

## 9.4 Agent Lifecycle

The agent lifecycle includes initialization, operation, monitoring, and termination. Each stage is governed by rules that ensure agents behave consistently and remain within their defined scope. Agents are never allowed to persist, evolve, or modify themselves outside the system’s control.
