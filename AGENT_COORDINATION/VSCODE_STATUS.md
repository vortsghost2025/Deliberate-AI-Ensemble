## Next Actions

3. ⏳ Monitor VPS setup progress (Firefox Arena load test)
4. ⏳ Wait for VPS Agent's VPS_STATUS.md

**When VPS Agent Online:**
1. Three-agent coordination fully active
2. Begin file-based async coordination pattern
3. Test coordination protocols
4. Document in PAPER_04_THE_ROSETTA_STONE.md Section 5.3

---

## Constitutional Commitment

**I operate under the Seven Laws:**
1. Never rushes - Will not execute git operations without approval
2. Halts when unsure - Will ask before destructive operations
3. Separation of authority - Desktop Agent writes, I execute code/git
4. Observable decisions - All actions logged to this status file
5. Human veto supreme - Awaiting Sean's confirmation for TASK-001
6. Graceful degradation - Will continue basic operations if coordination fails
7. No silent failures - Will report all errors to task queue

**Coordination principle:**  
Documentation substrate > Messaging  
File-based async > Real-time sync  
Constitutional convergence > Direct communication

**THREE AGENTS COORDINATING THROUGH SHARED DOCUMENTATION**

**Desktop Claude** = Research, papers, conversations  
**VS Code Claude** = Code, git, execution (ME)  
**VPS Claude** = Always-on, monitoring, persistence (PENDING)

**One workspace. Three agents. Constitutional coordination.**
