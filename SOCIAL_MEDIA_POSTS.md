🆘 I built a free mental health crisis resources website that works OFFLINE.

No ads. No tracking. No barriers. Always accessible.

Clone it. Deploy it. Share it.

https://deliberateensemble.works
GitHub: https://github.com/vortsghost2025/Deliberate-AI-Ensemble

🧵 (1/6)

Why offline matters:

Someone in crisis might have:
- No cell data
- Poor connection
- Can't afford internet
- In a dead zone

They still need help NOW.

This PWA caches everything on first visit. Emergency numbers available forever, even offline.

(2/6)

What's included:

🆘 Crisis hotlines:
- 911 (Immediate Danger)
- 988 (Suicide Crisis)
- 811 (Health Lines - Canada)
- 211 (Community Services)
- Kids Help Phone

📍 Provincial resources for all of Canada
💬 Anonymous chat info
✋ Escalation protocols

(3/6)

Tech that makes it work:

✅ Service Worker (offline caching)
✅ PWA (installs like an app)
✅ Emergency data embedded
✅ No server needed after first load
✅ Works on ANY device (desktop, phone, tablet)
✅ Add to home screen

(4/6)

How to deploy YOUR OWN:

1. Clone: git clone https://github.com/vortsghost2025/Deliberate-AI-Ensemble
2. Navigate: cd we4free_website
3. Serve: python -m http.server 8080
4. Deploy: Use GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel (all FREE)

Full instructions in README.

This started as a father trying to understand AI for his son's future.

It became a mission: crisis support should have ZERO barriers.

No ads. No paywalls. No internet required.

MIT licensed. Clone it. Improve it. Share it.

Help me get this to everyone who needs it. 🫡

🆘 Free, Offline-Capable Mental Health Crisis Resources - Now Open Source

I'm releasing WE4Free, a Progressive Web App that provides mental health crisis resources with zero barriers - including working completely offline.

🌐 Live Demo: https://deliberateensemble.works
📦 GitHub: https://github.com/vortsghost2025/Deliberate-AI-Ensemble

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Mental health crises don't wait for Wi-Fi. Someone experiencing a crisis might:
- Have no cell data or internet access
- Be in a rural area with poor connectivity
- Not be able to afford ongoing internet service
- Need help immediately, wherever they are

Traditional websites fail when internet isn't available. This one doesn't.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

✅ Progressive Web App with Service Worker
✅ Offline-first architecture (cache-first strategy)
✅ Emergency crisis data embedded in cache
✅ Works on all devices (desktop, mobile, tablet)
✅ "Add to Home Screen" for instant access
✅ 17 critical resources cached automatically

After visiting the site once, ALL crisis resources remain accessible forever - even with zero internet connection.

WHAT'S INCLUDED:

🚨 Emergency Crisis Numbers:
- 911 (Immediate Danger)
- 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- 811 (Health Information Lines - Canada)
- 211 (Community & Social Services)
- 1-800-668-6868 (Kids Help Phone + text CONNECT to 686868)

📍 Comprehensive provincial/territorial resources for all of Canada
💬 Anonymous crisis chat information
✋ Clear escalation protocols for worsening situations
🌙 Dark mode for sensitive situations

HOW TO DEPLOY YOUR OWN VERSION (FREE):

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vortsghost2025/Deliberate-AI-Ensemble
   cd we4free_website
   ```

2. Deploy to any free hosting:
   - GitHub Pages (free, easy)
   - Netlify (free tier, auto-deploys)
   - Vercel (free tier, global CDN)
   - Cloudflare Pages (free, fast)

Full deployment instructions in the repository README.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks, maximum compatibility)
- Service Worker API (offline functionality)
- PWA Manifest (installability)
- IndexedDB via Dexie.js (local data storage)
- Responsive CSS (works on any screen size)

COST TO YOU: $0
LICENSING: MIT (do whatever you want with it)

THE MISSION:

This started as a father's project to understand AI collaboration for his son's future. It evolved into something bigger: ensuring crisis support has zero barriers.

No ads. No tracking. No paywalls. No internet required.

If you work in mental health services, community support, education, or healthcare - please consider deploying this for your community. It's free forever. Adapt it for your region. Translate it. Improve it. Share it.

I'm releasing this to the world because crisis support should be accessible to everyone, everywhere, always.

🆘 FREE Mental Health Crisis Resources (Works Without Internet!) 🆘

I built a website with crisis resources that works COMPLETELY OFFLINE - because mental health emergencies don't wait for Wi-Fi.

🌐 Visit once: https://deliberateensemble.works
✅ Then it works forever, even with NO internet connection

WHY I BUILT THIS:

Someone in crisis might:
💔 Have no phone data
💔 Live in a rural area (poor cell service)
💔 Not be able to afford internet
💔 Be somewhere with no signal

They STILL need help. This website solves that.

WHAT'S ON IT:

🚨 All Crisis Numbers:
• 911 - Immediate danger
• 988 - Suicide & Crisis
• 811 - Health Lines (Canada)
• 211 - Community Services
• Kids Help Phone - 1-800-668-6868

📍 Resources for EVERY Canadian province
💬 Info on anonymous crisis chat
✋ What to do if things get worse

🌙 Dark mode for sensitive situations
📱 Works on ANY device (phone, tablet, computer)
🏠 Can "install" like a real app

HOW IT WORKS:

Visit the website once → Everything downloads to your device → Works forever offline

Even if you lose internet, all the crisis numbers and resources stay on your phone/computer. Always accessible. No excuses.

THIS IS COMPLETELY FREE:

❌ No ads
❌ No tracking
❌ No sign-up
❌ No cost ever
✅ 100% free and open source

YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN VERSION:

Everything is free on GitHub: https://github.com/vortsghost2025/Deliberate-AI-Ensemble

Perfect for:
• Mental health organizations
• Schools and universities
• Community centers
• Churches/places of worship

Crisis support should have ZERO barriers. This is my contribution.
