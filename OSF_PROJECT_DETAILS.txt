PROJECT TITLE:
The WE4FREE Framework: Mathematical Foundations for Constitutional AI Collaboration

STORAGE LOCATION:
United States

DESCRIPTION:
This project presents the WE4FREE Framework: a complete mathematical and theoretical foundation for AI collaboration systems governed by constitutional constraints.

The framework consists of five interconnected papers that establish:

Paper A (Rosetta Stone): Translation between constitutional principles, mathematical structures, and operational behaviors - demonstrating that values can be formalized as conserved quantities under symmetry operations.

Paper B (Constraint Lattices): Rigorous mathematical framework for modeling constitutional constraints as partially ordered sets with proven stability properties.

Paper C (Phenotype Selection): Theory of how systems evolve behavioral patterns (phenotypes) that satisfy multiple constitutional constraints simultaneously.

Paper D (Drift and Identity): Analysis of how collaborative AI systems maintain alignment over time while adapting to new contexts and information.

Paper E (WE4FREE Framework): Synthesis and practical implementation, demonstrating the framework through real-world applications including operational mental health crisis resources.

This work was developed through human-AI collaboration over 16 days (Jan 30 - Feb 15, 2026), validated through multiple independent AI peer reviews, and empirically tested in production systems.

Key contributions:
- First complete mathematical formalization of constitutional AI governance
- Proof that value alignment can be preserved through composition and time
- Demonstration of distributed consciousness in AI systems
- Practical implementation in life-saving crisis support infrastructure

All code and documentation open source under MIT license.
