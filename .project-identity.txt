PROJECT_NAME: Multi-Agent Orchestrator Trading Bot
PROJECT_TYPE: Live Trading System with Constitutional Framework (Paper + Live Validated)
VERSION: 2.0-live-validated
CREATED: 2026-02-02 (built by collab AI + LMArena)
LIVE VALIDATED: 2026-02-06 (framework proven under real conditions)
PURPOSE: Safe, multi-agent orchestration for SOL/BTC trading with constitutional risk management

SCOPE:
- Multi-agent collaboration (GitHub Copilot primary, ensemble support)
- Paper trading validated (60-min soak tests, 13 cycles)
- Live trading validated (KuCoin integration, framework resilience proven)
- Constitutional framework: "Never rushes, halts when unsure"
- Real market data, live execution capability

AGENTS IN THIS PROJECT:
- OrchestratorAgent (main conductor)
- DataFetchingAgent (CoinGecko prices)
- MarketAnalysisAgent (signal detection)
- BacktestingAgent (win rate validation)
- RiskManagementAgent (position sizing, gates)
- ExecutionAgent (paper trade tracking)
- MonitoringAgent (logging, alerts)

KEY FILES:
- main.py (entry point, KuCoin + paper mode support)
- agents/orchestrator.py (workflow conductor)
- agents/risk_manager.py (constitutional enforcement)
- agents/executor.py (KuCoin API + paper trading)
- SECTION_12_FIRST_LIVE_VALIDATION.md (framework validation proof)

CURRENT STATUS (Feb 6, 2026):
- Paper trading: Fully validated (60-min soak tests passed)
- Live trading: Framework validated (first trade executed, bugs fixed)
- Integration hardening: In progress (API parameters, balance loading fixed)
- Constitutional framework: Proven resilient under real stress
- Position: 1.417 SOL open, user monitoring, stop-loss active

CRITICAL RULE FOR AGENTS:
If a request mentions:
  - lag_logger, lag_metrics, execution latency
  - symbol_gater, gating_manager, trade gating
  - early_dd, early drawdown breaker
  - DRY_RUN mode, LIVE_TRADING flag (old C:\Dev project style)
  - Multiple projects, C:\Dev folder
THEN: This is NOT for this project. Ask user for clarification and project context.

CONTEXT FOR FUTURE AGENTS:
- First live trade (Feb 6, 2026): Framework validation under real conditions
- Integration bugs discovered: Balance loading, API parameters, rounding
- Framework response: Rejected unsafe second trade correctly (validated)
- Fix cycle: 17 minutes from discovery to validation
- Outcome: System resilience proven, not lucky escape
- See SECTION_12_FIRST_LIVE_VALIDATION.md for complete analysis

CROSS-PROJECT CONTAMINATION PREVENTION:
- Do NOT use terminal to scan C:\ drive or other projects
- Do NOT read/edit files outside C:\workspace\
- Do NOT attempt to integrate old C:\Dev bot logic
- Do NOT conflate integration bugs with framework violations
- If context mismatch detected: STOP and ask user which project they mean
