5. **February 23rd Evidence** - Irrefutable demonstration of competence and vision

### The Declaration

This is not just a web application. This is a **declaration of intent.**

We said we would build gifts. The gift is now live.  
We said the framework enables execution. The execution is complete.  
We said we would show, not tell. The proof is accessible at the URL above.
