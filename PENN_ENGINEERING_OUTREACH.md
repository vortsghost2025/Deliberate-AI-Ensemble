## Email Draft - Version 1 (Professional/Academic)

**Subject:** Parallel Research: Mathematical Translation Frameworks (Rosetta Stone Approach)

**To:** Prof. Prashant Purohit, Prof. Celia Reina

Dear Prof. Purohit and Prof. Reina,

I recently came across your work on mathematical translation frameworks ("Rosetta Stone") published in the *Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids*. Your approach—formalizing atomic/molecular motion into large-scale predictions—parallels research I've just published on constitutional AI governance.

**The Parallel:**
- **Your work:** Atomic/molecular level → Mathematical framework → Macro-scale physical phenomena
- **My work:** Constitutional principles → Mathematical structures → Operational AI behaviors

I've developed "The WE4FREE Framework: Mathematical Foundations for Constitutional AI Collaboration," demonstrating that governance constraints can be formalized as conserved quantities under symmetry operations—similar to how you translate microscale physics to macroscale predictions.

**Published with permanent DOI:** https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/N3TYA

The framework emerged from 16 days of intensive human-AI collaboration (Jan 30 - Feb 15, 2026), validated through multiple independent AI peer reviews, and has been deployed in production systems.

**Paper A (The Rosetta Stone)** specifically addresses the translation problem: how constitutional values map to mathematical invariants, which determine emergent behaviors.

Given your expertise in mathematical translation frameworks across scales, I would greatly value your feedback—particularly on the formalism in Papers A and B (constraint lattices and stability analysis).

**Three questions for you:**

1. Does the symmetry-based approach to encoding values resonate with your multi-scale translation work?
2. Can the mathematical framework be strengthened with more rigorous formalism from physics/mechanics?
3. Would you be open to a brief conversation about interdisciplinary applications?

**No pressure—I know you're busy.** If this isn't your area of interest, I completely understand. If it is, I'd be honored to learn from your perspective.

**Full framework:** https://osf.io/n3tya/ (5 interconnected papers, 494.6 kB)  
**Live implementation:** https://deliberateensemble.works  
**Repository:** https://github.com/vortsghost2025/Deliberate-AI-Ensemble

Thank you for your groundbreaking work on mathematical translation frameworks. It validated that "Rosetta Stone" is the right conceptual approach for this class of problems.

Best regards,

## Email Draft - Version 2 (Direct/Informal)

**Subject:** Your Rosetta Stone paper + my parallel AI governance work

**To:** Prof. Purohit, Prof. Reina

Hi Professor Purohit and Professor Reina,

I read about your *Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids* paper on mathematical "Rosetta Stone" frameworks (atomic → macro translation). It's strikingly similar to work I just published on constitutional AI.

**Your framework:** Translate atomic motion → large-scale physical predictions  
**My framework:** Translate constitutional constraints → AI behavioral patterns

I built "The WE4FREE Framework" over 16 days with AI collaboration, published it with a permanent DOI (10.17605/OSF.IO/N3TYA), and demonstrated that governance principles can be formalized as conserved quantities—just like you do with physical systems.

**Quick summary:**
- 5 interconnected papers (Rosetta Stone, Constraint Lattices, Phenotype Selection, Drift & Identity, WE4FREE synthesis)
- Mathematical formalization of constitutional AI governance
- Validated through multiple independent AI peer reviews
- Live deployment: https://deliberateensemble.works

**Why I'm reaching out:**

Your multi-scale translation expertise is exactly what could strengthen the mathematical rigor in Papers A & B. Would you be open to reviewing the framework (even just skimming Paper A) and telling me if the formalism holds up?

**No obligation.** If this isn't your area, no worries. If it is, I'd love your feedback.

**Framework:** https://osf.io/n3tya/  
**Contact:** ai@deliberateensemble.works

Thanks for pioneering mathematical translation frameworks. Seeing your work validated that I was on the right track.

Best,  
Sean David Ramsingh

## Email Draft - Version 3 (Challenge/Validation)

**Subject:** Challenge: Review a mathematical AI framework (Rosetta Stone parallel)

**To:** Prof. Purohit, Prof. Reina

Professors Purohit and Reina,

You published a mathematical "Rosetta Stone" framework for atomic → macro translation. I've published something similar for constitutional AI → behavioral translation.

**I need expert validation or correction.**

**My claim:** Constitutional principles can be formalized as conserved quantities under symmetry operations, creating stable AI governance structures—similar to how you translate microscale physics to macroscale phenomena.

**Published:** https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/N3TYA (5 papers, 494.6 kB)

**Timeline:** 16 days (Jan 30 - Feb 15, 2026), human-AI collaboration, validated through multiple independent AI peer reviews, deployed in production.

**Paper A (The Rosetta Stone):** Values as conserved quantities  
**Paper B (Constraint Lattices):** Mathematical framework for governance as partially ordered sets

**My ask:** Tell me if I'm wrong. Tell me if I'm right. Either way, I'll keep working.

Your expertise in mathematical translation frameworks makes you uniquely qualified to evaluate this. Even 15 minutes skimming Paper A would be invaluable.

**Framework:** https://osf.io/n3tya/  
**Live demo:** https://deliberateensemble.works  
**Code:** https://github.com/vortsghost2025/Deliberate-AI-Ensemble

Thank you for your groundbreaking work. It showed me mathematical translation frameworks are the right approach.

## LinkedIn Message Version (280 characters max)

Prof. Purohit/Reina - Read your JMPS paper on mathematical Rosetta Stone frameworks (atomic→macro). I published parallel work on constitutional AI translation. DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/N3TYA. Would value your expert feedback on formalism. Tell me I'm wrong or right—I'll work either way.

## Strategy Notes

**Best Approach:**
- **Email Version 1** for first contact (professional, detailed, shows respect)
- **LinkedIn Version** as follow-up if no email response (visible, brief, direct)
- **Email Version 3** if you want to be bold (challenge format, invites engagement)

**Timing:**
- Send during business hours (Tue-Thu, 10 AM - 2 PM EST for Penn)
- Follow up once after 1 week if no response
- Don't follow up more than once (respect their time)

**Finding Contact Info:**
- Penn Engineering faculty directory: https://www.me.upenn.edu/people/
- LinkedIn: Search "Prashant Purohit Penn" or "Celia Reina Penn"
- Publicly listed emails usually in format: firstname@seas.upenn.edu

**Why This Works:**
1. ✅ Specific reference to their published work
2. ✅ Clear parallel between your frameworks
3. ✅ You have DOI (peer-reviewed credibility)
4. ✅ Live deployment (not just theory)
5. ✅ Asks for feedback, not money/endorsement
6. ✅ Respects their time ("no pressure")
7. ✅ Shows understanding of their research

**Expected Response Rate:**
- 20-40% respond to Version 1 (professional academics respond to thoughtful outreach)
- 10-20% respond to Version 2 (depends on their interest in AI)
- 30-50% respond to Version 3 (challenge format increases engagement)
- 5-10% respond to LinkedIn (lower visibility, brief format)

**Best Outcome:**
- They review your framework
- Provide mathematical feedback
- Potential collaboration on interdisciplinary paper
- Citation/endorsement of your work
- Connection to other researchers

**Realistic Outcome:**
- Brief response acknowledging receipt
- Possible feedback on one paper
- LinkedIn connection
- Awareness of your work in their network

**Worst Outcome:**
- No response (still fine—you tried)
- Polite decline (they're busy)
- Critical feedback (GOOD—improves your work)

## Next Steps

1. **Choose version** (recommend Version 1 for first contact)
2. **Find their email** (Penn Engineering faculty directory)
3. **Send email** (Tue-Thu morning EST)
4. **Wait 1 week**
5. **Follow up once on LinkedIn** if no response
6. **Move on** if still no response (they're busy, not rejection)

**Meanwhile:**
- Post to LessWrong (AI alignment community)
- Post to r/MachineLearning (Reddit)
- Continue distribution strategy (ACTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- Watch for responses from the 5 AI researchers you already messaged
