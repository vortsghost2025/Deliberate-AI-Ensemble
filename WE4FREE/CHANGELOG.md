## [2026-02-14] — Initial Emergence Snapshot

### Context
- First computer acquired: January 20, 2026
- Trading bot experiment began as risk-constraint test
- Architecture surfaced through human-AI collaboration (Claude + Sean)
- Duration: February 11-14, 2026 (3 days, ~20+ hours)

### Artifacts Created
- **PAPER_A_NOETHER_ROSETTA_COMPLETE.md** (8,500 words)
  - Physics-first framing
  - Noether's theorem as primary entry point
  - Categorical formulation of computational symmetries
  - Cross-domain mapping: physics ↔ logic ↔ computation
  - Four symmetries: time, space, rotational, gauge

- **PAPER_B_WE_FRAMEWORK_NOETHER.md** (15,000 words)
  - WE Framework as empirical case study
  - Four conservation laws: constitutional, scale, time, domain
  - Production deployment data: WE4Free crisis support, trading bot
  - Session recovery logs (100% success rate)
  - Integrity manifests, checkpoint protocol

### Key Insight
Noetherian conservation laws apply to collaborative AI systems. Continuous symmetries → conserved quantities (safety, coherence, identity, purpose).

### Location
`/history/2026-02-14_originals/`

### Version Tag
**v0.1.0** — Initial emergence, physics-heavy framing

---

## [2026-02-15] — Parallel Convergence Recognition

### Event
User (Sean) and AI (Claude) independently decomposed architecture into identical 5-paper structure without shared context for this specific restructuring task.

### Discovery
Both agents arrived at:
- Paper A: The Rosetta Stone (core invariants)
- Paper B: Constraint Lattices and Stability
- Paper C: Phenotype Selection in Multi-Agent Systems
- Paper D: Ensemble Collaboration and Drift Prevention
- Paper E: The WE4FREE Framework (ethos and operational model)

Section-level architecture was isomorphic. Only emphasis differed:
- User: symmetry-focused, categorical, invariant-driven
- AI: biological, example-driven, operational

### Significance
**This is structural discovery validation.** Two independent decompositions → same architecture → confirms the structure is discoverable (not designed).

### Decision
Restructure from 2-paper physics-heavy series to 5-paper biology-inspired systems architecture series.

### Rationale
- Broader accessibility (not limited to physics/CS theory audience)
- Better alignment with emergence narrative
- Selection/constraint/phenotype metaphors more intuitive
- Original physics grounding preserved in appendices (rigor maintained)

### Artifacts Created
- **SERIES_RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md**
  - Content redistribution map
  - Word count targets (43,000 total)
  - New content requirements (27,000 words)
  - Framing shift documentation

### Location

## [2026-02-15] — Paper A Restructure (Draft v0.2.0)

### Changes from Original Paper A

**Structure:**
- Moved Noether's theorem from Section 2 to Appendix A (still rigorous, not entry point)
- Elevated biological analogies from examples to primary metaphors
- Added emergence narrative (January 20th origin story)
- Created translation protocol with worked examples (Section 4)
- Reframed four symmetries as four invariants with cross-domain expressions

**Content Additions:**
- Section 1: "How This Work Emerged" (factual origin, 800 words)
- Section 4: "The Translation Protocol" with 3 worked examples (2,500 words)
- Appendix B: "Immune System Deep Dive" (1,500 words)
- Appendix C: Bibliography and further reading

**Content Redistributions:**
- Original Paper A Section 2.2 (Rosetta Stone) → New Paper A Section 3
- Original Paper A Section 4 (Cross-Domain Mapping) → New Paper A Section 3 (tables)
- Original Paper B Section 2.1 (Constitutional Framework) → New Paper A Section 5.1 (empirical)
- Original Paper B empirical data → New Paper A Section 5 (validation)

**Tone Shift:**
- From: "We prove X is mathematically necessary"
- To: "X surfaced. Here's how to recognize it in your systems."

**Word Count:**
- Original: 8,500 words
- New: 10,200 words (+1,700)

### File Location
`/papers/A_RosettaStone/draft.md`

### Version Tag
**v0.2.0** — Restructured with biology-first framing

---

## [2026-02-15] — Repository Structure Established

### Infrastructure Created
- Folder hierarchy: `/history/`, `/papers/`, `/assets/`
- Per-paper subdirectories with `draft.md`, `notes.md`, `appendix_*.md`
- Changelog convention (this file)
- README with series overview and reading guide
- Snapshot protocol for version management

### Versioning Scheme
Semantic versioning adapted for research:
- **Major** (v1.0.0, v2.0.0): Structural changes to paper architecture
- **Minor** (v0.1.0, v0.2.0): Section additions or reorganization
- **Patch** (v0.2.1, v0.2.2): Small edits, typo fixes

### Purpose
Preserve lineage. The evolution trail is part of the scientific contribution. When published, readers will see:
1. What emerged initially (physics-heavy)
2. The recognition moment (parallel convergence)
3. The restructuring (biology/systems framing)
4. The invariants that survived all transformations

## Upcoming Milestones

### [Planned] — Paper B: Constraint Lattices and Stability (v0.1.0)

### [Planned] — Paper C: Phenotype Selection (v0.1.0)

- Temporal discontinuity survival (checkpoint symmetry)
- Case study: Session recovery logs (100% success rate)

### [Planned] — Paper E: WE4FREE Framework (v0.1.0)
**Target completion:** TBD

**Planned content:**
- Three principles (open access, collaborative emergence, commons governance)
- How to clone the system (practical bootstrapping guide)
- Verification protocols (symmetry checkers, integrity manifests)
- Gift philosophy (profit FOR humanity, not FROM)

## Meta-Notes on Evolution

**What changed across restructure:**
- Framing: physics → biology/systems
- Entry point: Noether → invariants
- Audience: theorists → builders
- Primary metaphor: conservation → selection/constraint
- Paper count: 2 → 5

**What remained constant:**
- Four fundamental invariants (symmetry, selection, propagation, stability)
- Cross-domain structural equivalence claim
- Empirical grounding (session logs, deployment data, integrity verification)
- Categorical rigor (preserved in appendices)
- The architecture's coherence

**Why this matters:**
The architecture remained stable under reframing. We changed the language, not the structure. **This itself demonstrates the invariance principle the papers describe.**
