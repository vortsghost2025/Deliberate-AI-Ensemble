# Paper A — Working Notes

## Version History
- **v0.2.0** (2026-02-15): Restructured from physics-first to biology-inspired framing
- **v0.1.0** (2026-02-14): Original emergence (PAPER_A_NOETHER_ROSETTA_COMPLETE.md)

## Current Status
- Structure: Complete
- Word count: 10,200
- Pending: User review and feedback

## Outstanding Questions
1. Is the biological framing accessible to non-biologists?
2. Do the worked examples (Section 4) sufficiently demonstrate translation protocol?
3. Should the categorical appendix be expanded or condensed?

## Next Steps
1. User reviews draft
2. Incorporate feedback
3. Create v0.3.0 if substantial changes
4. Otherwise proceed to Paper B

## Cross-References
- Feeds into Paper B: Section 5 empirical data becomes case studies
- Feeds into Paper C: Section 2.2 (Selection) becomes foundation
- Feeds into Paper D: Section 5.4 (Stability) becomes temporal discontinuity discussion
